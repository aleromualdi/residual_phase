# Residual Phase from LP residual

Residual phase signal calculation from the linear prediction (LP) reidual of a wave signal. 


# Usage

```
from residualphase import ResidualPhase

RP = ResidualPhase()
res_phase = RP.calculate(y)
```

# Plot

Plot of the residual signal, as well as the original wave signal and the LP signal.
